# Pro/g/ramming-Roulette
**_"Test Your Skills"_**

## What is the Pro/g/ramming Roulette?
The programming roulette web app generates programming challenges for you to test your programming skills.  The web app has dozens of different challenges for you to use, and even generates random programming languages for you to use.

Inspired by a programming board, most of the challenges are created and put together by a variety of users.

## How do I play?
**0. Set up a reposity**
* git init should do the job early and push and update code often

**1. Understand the problem**
* Use Generally Useful Resources to find out more information about what your're facing. If you need, use paper, draw diagrams, bite pencils. 
* If the problem seems too difficult, try to simplify it, find a special case that may be easier to design and implement. If it seems too easy, generalise, invent more complicated variations, perhaps try to combine with other problems.

**2. Implement**
* Start with whatever language you know best or feel most confortable with. If the problem is easy, pick a language you've never used before or one that you don't know too well yet. Don't be afraid to write ugly or nonidiomatic code as long as understand what's going on. You can clear up the mess later.

**3. Test**
* Write tests that check both the ordinary and the exceptional cases of your program. Compile/interpret/eval whatever you've written and run the tests. Find bugs, fix them and repeat. Again, commit often lest your progress disappear into the abyss

**4. Reimplement**
* Now that you have a reference implementation, you can go wild. Reimplement the task in different language this time, perhaps the one you've been meaning to learn since years ago. Try to achieve the same outcome using different techniques, use different idioms. Try to make the code as short as possible or the contrary.

## RULES
**1. No stealing of other's people work, only use them as references.**

**2. Spin as much as you like, but remember to spin for the "initative.**

**3. Breaks are allowed, Quitting is not.**

**4. Share your work, no point in hoarding your genius.**
